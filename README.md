DESCRIPTION: 
This Python script is a **multi-purpose penetration testing toolkit** designed to help security testers assess the security posture of a web application or network. It offers five key functionalities: a **port scanner** to check for open common ports on a host, a **brute-force login module** that attempts to guess credentials using supplied username and password wordlists, a **web vulnerability scanner** that checks for SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting known payloads, a **directory enumerator** that tries to discover hidden directories or pages using a wordlist, and an **IP information lookup** that fetches geolocation and other metadata using an external API. The script features a simple interactive menu, making it easy to navigate and run various tools. This toolkit provides a basic but practical foundation for learning and performing ethical hacking or security assessments.
